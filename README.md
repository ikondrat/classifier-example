# FastAPI Seed Project

A modern FastAPI-based application template with built-in support for machine learning models using PyTorch and Transformers.

## Features

- FastAPI framework for high-performance API development
- PyTorch integration for machine learning capabilities
- Transformers library support for state-of-the-art NLP models
- Modern development tooling:
  - Ruff for linting and formatting
  - MyPy for type checking
  - Pytest for testing
  - UV for dependency management

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher ([Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- UV package manager ([Installation Guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation))

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd classifier_demo
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

This will install all required dependencies using UV package manager.

## Development

The project includes several development commands:

- Run the application:

```bash
make run
```

- Run tests:

```bash
make test
```

- Lint code:

```bash
make lint
```

- Check types:

```bash
make type-check
```

- Format code:

```bash
make format
```

- Validate code (runs lint, type-check, and format-check):

```bash
make validate
```
